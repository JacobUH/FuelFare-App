# React + TypeScript + Vite + Bootstrap ðŸŒ¿

This template provides a minimal setup to get our application running on your local device!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version X or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version X or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   (bash or zsh)

```
- https://github.com/JacobUH/TeamProject4353.git
- git@github.com:JacobUH/TeamProject4353.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Running the Application

Make sure once you download the repository to your local computer, be sure that you are in the ./frontend folder when running the application with the command below. Easily enough, we configured the environment well. Just run this simple command in your terminal of choice after completing the previous steps:

```
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 or whatever localhost is promted in your terminal to view the app!
